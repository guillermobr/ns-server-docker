Categories:

==============================================
=--------------------------------------------=
"SQUAD" commands ("rcbot squad ...")
=--------------------------------------------=
==============================================

"rcbot squad formation <string argument>"

the string argument can be a string of as follows:

"echleft"   (Echelon left formation)
"echright"  (Echelon Right formation)
"wedge"     (Wedge formation)
"vee"       (Vee formation)
"line"      (Line formation)
"column"    (Column formation)

=--------------------------------------------=

"rcbot squad spread <floating point number argument>"

The floating point nu,ber argument is a real number
which denoted the distance between each squad member.

=--------------------------------------------=
Squad Menu
=--------------------------------------------=

"rcbot squad_menu"

Opens the squad menu to alter your squad.

==============================================
=--------------------------------------------=
"CONFIG" commands ("rcbot config ...")
=--------------------------------------------=
=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config <config type> <argument>"

<config type> are any of these below (i.e. commanding, 
dont_shoot etc.)
===========================================================
"rcbot chat_dont_learn <boolean arg (1 or 0)>"

if set to 1 then bots won't leanr humans messages anymore, this means that
the .brn files in the botprofiles folder won't get any bigger.

so this is useful if the .brn files are getting very large.
===========================================================
"rcbot config balance_teams <boolean>"

if set to 1 the bots will try to join another team if they can't
join the team they want to join.

===========================================================
"rcbot config marine_auto_build <boolean>". 

If set to 1, an infantry portal will automatically be built nearby 
the command console when a bot joins the server.

Waypoints need to be on the map for this to find a position for
the infantry portal.
===========================================================
"rcbot config reserve_bot_slots <boolean>"

If set to 1, and if "min bots" is set then upon map change
bots will not join until after a few seconds, if a client
attempts to join before this and the number of bots
will be less than "min bots" when the server gets full because
of this client joining, it will kick the client, disallowing the client
to join the server.

===========================================================
"rcbot config chat_percent <integer arg (0 - 100)>"

This command affects the bot chat stored in bot_chat.ini
The bot will chat less if this is low, more if it is high.

===========================================================
"rcbot config chat_reply_to_bots" <boolean argument>

if set to 1 then bots will reply to other bots in bot chat.

===========================================================
"rcbot config chat_reply_percent <integer arg (0 - 100)>"

This command affects the rate at which bots will reply to
messages using megaHAL.

The bot will chat less if this is low, more if it is high.

===========================================================
"rcbot config bot_stuck_speed <integer arg (0 - 100)>"

The bots will reply to messages using megaHAL more if this
value is increased.

===========================================================
"rcbot config bot_stuck_speed <floating point arg (speed)>"

This command is the speed of which a bot will wait until it kills itself 
if really stuck (determined by its speed), they must be going faster than this
speed for a small amount of time so that they dont suicide.

If you make it too high they might kill theirselves too much.
The default is 7. Make it negative (e.g. -1) to disallow it. 

=====================================================================

"rcbot config update_vision_time <floating point argument (in time)>"

This command is the amount of time between each visibility check that a bot makes.
Larger values mean better performance but slakier bots (they think they can still see things.. but they can't really...) This also depends on the max_update_vision_revs command, see below.

I recommend this value to be around 0.04 to about 0.10, you should change it depending on how many bots are running if the game slows down.

=============================================== 

"rcbot config max_update_vision_revs <integer>"

This command tells the bot how many times it should search it's visibility every 0.04 or the "update_vision_time" command in seconds.

Higher values mean the bot will eat more CPU power, lower values are better for lower CPU for higher performance. I recommend about 100 to about 200.

===============================================

"rcbot config max_path_revs <integer>"

This command tells the bot how many times to loop through the pathfinding
algorithm each time they enter it (every 0.04 seconds)

The lower the value, the better CPU performance, but takes bots longer to find
their path (i.e. they will just stand still until they find it)

The higher the value, more CPU is used and the bot may find its path quicker.

I recommened to keep it quite low however, about 300 (default is 300) you can
alter it in the game or in the bot_config.ini file.

=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config update_ladder_time <float value>"

input a floating point (real number) value

-1.0 means that the bot will not update ladder angles so that they
     will not jerk around on the ladders all the time.

0.0  means that they will always face towards the next waypoint but
     will tend to jerk around a lot becuase their angles are changing
     very quickly

any other number means they will update their ladder angles every x seconds, where x
is the value you enter.

=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config gorge_amount <float value>"

Sets the ratio for the amount of the team to go 
gorge, default is 0.4

=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config commanding"

(NOT AVAILABLE YET!)
Used in NS: Marines try to use command chair
=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config wait_for_orders"

Used in NS: Marines wait for orders from the commander
=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config dont_shoot"

Bots don't look for enemies
=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config chatting"

Set to 1 to allow bot talking/chatting. 0 to disable.
=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config real_mode"

(NOT AVAILABLE YET!)
Bots will join/leave game as they please.
=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config max_bots"

Set to -1 to disable auto-bot adding/removing.
If max bots is set to 8, for example then bots
will keep getting added until the amount of bots 
reach 8.

=-------------------------------------------=
"rcbot config min_bots"

Set to -1 to disable auto-bot adding/removing 
with min_bots. If min_bots is 4 it will add 4 
bots automatically. If a player trys to join when
a server is full and number of bots = min_bots
then the player can't join. But if the number
of bots is more than min_bots then a bot will
be kicked so that the player can join.

==============================================
=--------------------------------------------=
ADMIN commands
=--------------------------------------------=
==============================================
"rcbot set_pass <password>"

Sets your pass word to <password> for accessing bot commands
you must have the same name and password as in the bot_users.ini
file to have access to bot commands from another server/dedicated server
on the client.
