          <p><a name="q1"></a><b>Q: I type &quot;addbot&quot; in console and it 
            says &quot;unknown command&quot;!</b></p>
          <p>A: type &quot;rcbot addbot&quot; !!!<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; 
            </a></p>
          <p><b><a name="q16"></a>Q: Alright, I type &quot;rcbot addbot&quot; 
            and it still says &quot;unknown command&quot;</b></p>
          <p>A: This could be of a few reasons:</p>
          <p>1. There are two gamedll lines or two gamedll_linux lines that are 
            uncommented in the liblist.gam file for the MOD you want to use. You 
            should only ever have ONE of each of these lines.<br />
            2. If using metamod, the bot may be installed in the wrong folder 
            or you have entered the path wrong in metamod's plugins.ini file.</p>
          <p>1 : If using the stand alone dll (without metamod) open the liblist.gam 
            and remove any other lines that start with &quot;gamedll&quot; other 
            than the line which gives the bot dll.</p>
          <p>2 : If using metamod, type &quot;meta list&quot; in the console. 
            If it shows rcbot_mm...dll/so status is 'badf' it means the file could 
            not be found (meaning the path written in metamod's plugin.ini file 
            is wrong). If it isn't shown at all then you haven't wrote the bot 
            dll path into metamod's plugins.ini file and still need to do it. 
            Some people have found that changing the '/' folder characters in 
            the rcbot path in metamod's plugin file to windows folder character 
            (backslash : '\') will work.<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>

        <blockquote> 
          <p><a name="q2"></a><b>Q: I type &quot;rcbot addbot&quot; and the console 
            says something about &quot;no profiles are free&quot;</b></p>
          <p>A: Bots have their own profiles stored as files in the botprofiles 
            folder. Also the file called bot_profiles.ini must have numbers in 
            them (each line is a valid profile number).</p>
          <p> The most common situation is that you simply have not installed 
            rcbot to the correct folder. RCBot must be installed ABOVE the mod 
            folder (that's the same folder where the MOD folder is, NOT inside 
            the MOD folder!)</p>
          <p> In STEAM, and if running mods such as deathmatch classic where the 
            mod is in its own folder (i.e. not inside half-life steam app folder), 
            you must make another copy of the bot folder and put it in the &quot;steamapps/&lt;email&gt;&quot; 
            folder too.</p>
          <p> So you may get this error if:</p>
          <p> - you haven't installed the bot to the correct folder<br>
            - there are no profiles in the botprofiles folder / the botprofiles 
            folder doesn't exist<br>
            - there are no lines in the bot_profiles.ini file (which denote valid 
            bot profiles)<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><b><a name="q15"></a>Q: I am running Linux, I have installed everything 
            to the correct folder but when loading the bot it says &quot;Load 
            Library Failed&quot;</b></p>
          <p>First of all this could be because the bot is again not installed 
            into the correct folder, or the gamedll_linux line in liblist.gam 
            is pointing to the wrong .so file or the path is written incorrectly.</p>
          <p>If the installation folder and liblist.gam seem fine then you may 
            need to download the GNU C++ Libraries for backward compatability. 
            The bot is compiled on gcc on mandrake 8.2 (don't know what gcc version 
            it is to be honest!) and may need the libraries to link the dll file 
            with metamod etc. Download the libraries for your linux distribution.<a href="#top">&lt;back

          <h2>SQUADS</h2>
          <p><a name="q3"></a><b>Q: How do I make a squad from bots on my team?</b><br>
          </p>
          <p>A: Use the squad menu (&quot;rcbot squad_menu&quot;), you can bind 
            a key to it and then select<br>
            &quot;more options&quot; and then &quot;make squad&quot;. Alternatively 
            you can say &quot;form up&quot; in a team<br>
            message.<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><a name="q4"></a><b>Q: No bots will join my squad when I want them 
            to</b><br>
          </p>
          <p>A: You must be nearby bots to be able to make a squad from them<a href="#top">&lt;back 
            to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><a name="q5"></a><b>Q: They still won't join my squad even if I am 
            really close to them!</b><br>
          </p>
          <p>A: Probably the bots have got a squad already of their own. You can 
            remove the squads made by bots (or being lead by bots) by using the 
            squad menu. Choose the &quot;more options&quot; item in the squad 
            menu and then &quot;remove all bot squads&quot; Then try making a 
            squad again.<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><b><a name="q13"></a>Q: I try to make a squad and enemies join my 
            squad!</b><br />
          </p>
          <p>A: If you have godmode or notarget mode on then enemies might join 
            your squad because the enemy check will return false.<a href="#top">&lt;back 
            to top&gt; </a></p>
          <h2>NATURAL SELECTION MOD</h2>
          <p><b><a name="q14"></a>Q: Bots in NS marine team don't build! So they 
            can't respawn if they die.</b><br>
          </p>
          <p>A: Try using the 'rcbot config marine_auto_build' command. It will 
            create an infantry portal near the command console provided there 
            are waypoints on the map.<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><a name="q12"></a><b>Q: How do I get RCBot and Whichbot (NS Bot : 
            http://www.whichbot.com) to work together?</b></p>
          <p>i. Download latest RCBot and whichbot<br>
            ii. Extract the bots to their locations<br>
            iii. Get the latest metamod dll file from http://www.metamod.org<br>
            iv. Extract metamod dll into ns/addons/metamod/dlls and overwrite 
            the old file.<br>
            v. Edit the metamod plugins.ini file and make sure these lines are 
            in the file:</p>
          <p>win32 addons/whichbot/dlls/whichbot.dll<br>
            win32 ../rcbot/dlls/rcbot_mm.dll</p>
          <p>Similarly for linux, edit the plugins.ini file to point to the metamod 
            linux dll files instead. (see metamod documentation if unsure) <a href="#top">&lt;back 
            to top&gt; </a></p>
          <h2>ADMINISTRATING</h2>
          <p><a name="q6"></a><b>Q: Can you run the bot on a dedicated server?</b></p>
          <p>A: The bot should run fine on a dedicated server, you can access<br>
            the commands by using the same as the client (i.e. to add a bot use<br>
            the command &quot;rcbot addbot&quot;)<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; 
            </a></p>
          <p><a name="q7"></a><b>Q: The bots always just stand still!</b></p>
          <p>A: The map must have waypoints, you can make your own or look for 
            some on my waypoints page on the bot site or the bot forum. If it 
            does have waypoints type &quot;rcbot debug nav 1&quot; and it will 
            write in the console what the bots are trying to do, perhaps there 
            are problems with the waypoint paths etc, or there is a bug you must 
            sort out.<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><a name="q8"></a><b>Q: How do I set up my server so I or others can 
            have access to bot commands?</b></p>
          <p>A: The procedure has changed a lot since last RCBot because of the 
            introduction of steam. Read the &quot;Admin Use&quot; section in the 
            rcbot readme and also the bot_users.ini file (<i>open with notepad</i>) 
            and read the comments on how to add a user. Note that the test in 
            the bot_users.ini file is <i>case-sensitive</i>! <a href="#top">&lt;back 
            to top&gt; </a></p>
          <h2>PERFORMANCE</h2>
          <p><a name="q9"></a><b>Q: The bot uses too much CPU / framerate is low 
            with bots running.<br>
            </b></p>
          <p>A: Change some of the performance settings, these are typical bot 
            commands. They are:</p>
          <p> rcbot config max_path_revs<br>
            rcbot config update_vision_time<br>
            rcbot config max_update_vision_revs</p>
          <p> See the bot_commands.txt file for more information on these commands.<a href="#top">&lt;back

          <h2>WAYPOINTS &amp; NAVIGATION</h2>
          <p><a name="q10"></a><b>Q: What are the .rcw files in Waypoints folder?</b></p>
          <p>A: These are the waypoints for the maps, each waypoint is in a folder 
            corresponding to the MOD it is for also.<a href="#top">&lt;back to 
            top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><a name="q11"></a><b>Q: What are the .rcv files in the Waypoints 
            folder?</b></p>
          <p>A: These are the waypoint visibility files, they store info on each 
            waypoint if a waypoint is visible from another to work out best cover 
            places etc.<a href="#top">&lt;back to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><b><a name="q17"></a>Q: How do I make my own waypoints?</b></p>
          <p>See the waypoint readme that you get with the bot!<a href="#top">&lt;back 
            to top&gt; </a></p>
          <p><b><a name="q18"></a>Q: How do I install waypoints I downloaded?</b></p>
          <p>i. If you downloaded a &quot;.zip&quot; file open the zip file with 
            winzip or other zip compressor utility and extract the .rcw file into 
          </p>
          <p>&lt;HALF LIFE FOLDER&gt;/rcbot/waypoints/&lt;MOD FOLDER NAME&gt;/</p>
          <p>ii. If you downloaded an &quot;.rcw&quot; file then save it to the 
            same folder above</p>
          <p></p>
          <p>-: Replace &lt;HALF LIFE FOLDER&gt; to the folder where your half-life 
            hl.exe is stored.<br>
            -: Replace &lt;MOD FOLDER NAME&gt; with the name of the MOD's folder 
            that the MOD is used in.</p>
          <p><br>
            -: Delete the .rcv file that has the same name as the map that the 
            waypoints are for to save possible crashing and bad performance.<a href="#top">&lt;back

            stop learning from people chatting?</b></p>
          <p>If you want bots to stop learning the language people are speaking 
            altogether (for reasons such as that your megaHal brain .brn files 
            are becoming huge) you can disable bots learning by using the config

          <p>You will need to put the reply percentage down. Use the config variable 
            &quot;rcbot config chat_reply_percent&quot; and enter then percentage 
            of time you want them to reply to messages. Plus you may have bots 
            responding to other bots that will cause a lot of messages. If real

            specify a certain .trn file for it to train the megaHAL brain if none 
            exists so that it has something it can say without needing bots to 
            see humans say messages. If no .trn file is specified in the botprofile
