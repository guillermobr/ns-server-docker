<p>Waypointing Ladders:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a waypoint at the bottom of the ladder</li>
  <li>Create a waypoint at the very top of the ladder on the ledge where the bot 
    should walk on after leaving the ladder. If there is no ledge then put no-clip 
    ON (See commands readme.) and then put a waypoint at this point inside the 
    ladder. This is so that the bot knows what direction to look while climbing.</li>
  <li>If the last waypoint you made is not a &quot;ladder waypoint&quot; then 
    use the waypoint menu to give it the ladder type.</li>
  <li>Make a normal waypoint at the very bottom of the ladder near the first ladder 
    waypoint and give it a path to the ladder waypoint. Make sure the path to 
    the ladder waypoint is facing the direction you want the bot to look when 
    climbing the ladder.</li>
  <li>Make another normal waypoint nearby the last waypoint and make the only 
    path point towards the last waypoint you made.</li>
